                <p>Therapeutic massage is a type of bodywork specifically focused on improving physical health and relieving pain or discomfort. Unlike relaxation massage, which is more about stress relief, therapeutic massage targets specific areas of the body to address injuries, muscle tension, chronic pain, or other medical conditions. It uses various techniques to manipulate the muscles, connective tissue, and fascia to promote healing and improve mobility.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Common therapeutic massage techniques include:</strong></p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Swedish massage:</strong> Gentle, long strokes to improve circulation and relaxation.<br>
                    <strong>Deep tissue massage:</strong> More intense pressure to work through deeper muscle layers and break up chronic tension.<br>
                    <strong>Trigger point therapy:</strong> Targeting specific "knots" or tight areas in muscles that cause pain or discomfort.<br>
                    <strong>Sports massage:</strong> Often used by athletes to prevent injury or address muscle strains and stiffness.<br>
                    <strong>Myofascial release:</strong> A technique that focuses on releasing tightness in the fascia, the connective tissue surrounding muscles.<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Therapeutic massage can help with a wide range of conditions, such as back pain, headaches, muscle tension, stress, anxiety, and even rehabilitation after injuries. Itâ€™s often recommended as part of a holistic approach to managing pain or improving mobility.</p>
