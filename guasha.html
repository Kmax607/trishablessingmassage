        <p>Gua Sha is a traditional healing technique that involves scraping a smooth-edged stainless steel tool across the skin to stimulate circulation, release muscle tension, and promote healing. The word "gua" means "to scrape" and "sha" refers to the red, raised skin that can appear after the treatment, which is believed to indicate the release of stagnation or toxins from the body.<br><br>

          Gua Sha is commonly used on the body to treat muscle pain, tightness, and inflammation. The practitioner will typically apply oil to the skin and then use the tool to scrape in long, firm strokes along the muscles or along meridian lines in the body. The treatment can sometimes cause temporary redness or bruising, but the effects are generally seen as therapeutic, helping with pain relief, improved blood flow, and faster healing.<br><br>

          In recent years, Gua Sha has also gained popularity in facial treatments, where it's used to promote lymphatic drainage, reduce puffiness, and improve skin tone and texture. When used on the face, the strokes are gentler, and it's believed to help with facial muscle relaxation and a healthy glow.<br><br>
