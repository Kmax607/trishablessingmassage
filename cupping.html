                <p>Cupping therapy is a traditional healing practice that involves placing special cups on the skin to create suction. The suction is believed to help improve circulation, relieve muscle tension, and promote the flow of "qi" (energy) in the body. It’s often used in Chinese medicine, but variations of it can also be found in Middle Eastern and other traditional healing practices.</p>
                <p>The cups can be made of glass, bamboo, or silicone, and the therapist may use heat (fire) or a mechanical pump to create the suction. Once the cups are applied, they may be left in place for a few minutes or moved along the skin in some cases. The suction is said to pull toxins to the surface, and many people report feeling more relaxed or having reduced pain after a session.</p>
                <p>Cupping therapy is often used to treat conditions like muscle pain, inflammation, poor circulation, and respiratory issues (such as colds or coughs). You might see some marks on the skin afterward—usually round bruises—because of the suction, but these typically fade within a few days.</p>
