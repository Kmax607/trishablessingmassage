      <h3>Your innate intelligence to heal</h3>
      <p>The Spinal Flow Technique ("Spinal Flow") is a powerful modality that facilitates rebalancing the body and its function without manually adjusting the spine. It consists of light touches on specific points on the body that consist of the dura mater, a membrane that protects the brain and spinal cord. Spinal Flow is cutting-edge science and healing arts.</p>

      <p>Founded by Dr. Carli Axford, the Spinal Flow Technique is a very specific technique based on the 7 gateways of the spine and 33 access points that facilitate healing via the nervous system.</p>

      <p>I have helped clients with pain, stiffness, digestive issues, sleep issues, anxiety, headache, teeth grinding, hyperactivity, digestive issues, autism, self-regulation, eczema, inflammation issues, stress, tics, fibromyalgia, spinal issues, and more.</p>

      <p>Spinal Flow finds, identifies and releases layers of physical, chemical and emotional-mental tension, effecting ease in the body. It also uncovers stored trauma that’s been in the body for a long time, causing blockages, disease and illness. This hidden trauma resides in the spine or the nervous system; finding it allows the person to feel and discard it so that it doesn’t continue to block them in life.</p>

      <p>Spinal Flow facilitates rebalancing our nervous system by restoring our parasympathetic nervous system, which activates our innate ability to self-regulate, release stress, heal, and regenerate.</p>

      <p>As a result of exploring Spinal Flow, people experience a Spinal Flow healing wave where every cell of the body feels connected and free.</p>

      <p>After each session, you will experience more energy and ease, enjoy more restful sleep, focus and mental clarity, and an overall feeling of well-being.</p>

      <p>Spinal Flow is a fully approved technique, fully accredited by the International Institute of Complementary Therapists.</p>

      <h3>A Holistic Approach to Healing</h3>
      <p>The Spinal Flow Technique is a gentle, holistic approach to healing that focuses on releasing blockages along the spine to restore the body’s natural flow of energy and improve overall well-being. It works by accessing points on the spine to activate the nervous system, allowing the body to heal from pain, stress, and discomfort. This technique promotes deep relaxation, balance, and a return to optimal health without force or manipulation.</p>

      <p>Each of my sessions is unique and customized to meet the individual needs of my clients. Client remains fully clothed.</p>
