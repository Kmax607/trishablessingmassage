      <h3>Your innate intelligence to heal</h3>
      <p>&#9;Spinal Flow is a healing technique developed by Dr. Carli Axford that combines principles from chiropractic care, energy work, and mindfulness to promote balance and wellness. It focuses on enhancing the body’s natural ability to heal itself by facilitating the free flow of energy and spinal movement.</p>

      <p>&#9;The technique involves gentle touch along access points, particularly along the spine, to help release tension, blockages, and imbalances in the nervous system. Spinal Flow aims to improve communication between the brain and the rest of the body by addressing misalignments in the spine and promoting optimal function of the nervous system.</p>

      <p>&#9;It’s often used to treat a variety of issues, including chronic pain, stress, tension, and other physical or emotional imbalances. The idea is that by restoring the proper flow of energy through the body, overall health and well-being can be enhanced.</p>

      <p>&#9;Spinal Flow is considered non-invasive and gentle, focusing on the body's own healing processes.</p>

      <h3>A Holistic Approach to Healing</h3>
      <p>&#9;The Spinal Flow Technique is a gentle, holistic approach to healing that focuses on releasing blockages along the spine to restore the body’s natural flow of energy and improve overall well-being. It works by accessing points on the spine to activate the nervous system, allowing the body to heal from pain, stress, and discomfort. This technique promotes deep relaxation, balance, and a return to optimal health without force or manipulation.</p>

      <p>&#9;Each of my sessions is unique and customized to meet the individual needs of my clients. Clients remain fully clothed.</p>
